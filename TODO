* Buffer input until all 4 lines are available? May not be necessary since we're timebounding the broadcasts
* BarGraph improvements: 
** Can make bar graph be hori or vertical
** Need to figure out how to draw range for negative numbers 
*** Use same logic as tach - determine where value is as portion of total range then scale size.
* Need to add labels / readout to all graphics
* Tach is ugly :)
* What's going on with TPS when car is running?
* FPR and IAC guesses were wrong.
* Switch from millions of canvases to a more appropriate container architecture in JavaFX
* Need to add demo mode for displays (and turn demo code back on for tach, using demo mode
* Minimize usage of Strings - undoutedly churning a lot of memory.
** This could also be why the performance is bad. Just realized that we're blocking on input when polling as that whole process is single threaded. Need to look at memory usage (test device could be GC'ing a lot) as well as potentially dropping inbound data.)
** After updating simulation, shows processing thread taking ~100MB of memory. Let's see if we can minimize this. Looks like ~10MB is getting churned in garbage collection from watching the process monitor.
